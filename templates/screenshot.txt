# Theme Screenshot Instructions

To add a screenshot for your WordPress theme:

1. Create a PNG image file named "screenshot.png"
2. Recommended size: 1200x900 pixels
3. Place it in the theme root directory (same level as style.css)
4. The screenshot will appear in the WordPress admin theme selection

Example screenshot content:
- Show your React theme in action
- Include the modern design elements
- Display the hero section or main features
- Use high-quality, professional imagery

The screenshot helps users preview your theme before activating it.
